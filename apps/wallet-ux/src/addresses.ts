/**
 * Frontend address book for Base Sepolia (chain id 84532) only.
 *
 * Live slots come from src/base-sepolia.json, a copy of
 * deployments/base-sepolia.json kept inside this app so a Pages build with
 * root directory apps/wallet-ux does not import a parent path. `npm run dev`
 * and `npm run build` refresh the copy when the repo-root book is visible.
 * The corrected Gate A pin is the fallback when that file fails validation.
 * The superseded Denylist (0xF0f2…) and Vault (0xa1a0…) are never read targets.
 * There is no mainnet book.
