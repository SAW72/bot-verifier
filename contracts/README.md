# Contracts

Working Solidity for the on-chain layers. **Testnet only.** Mainnet is refused by the deploy script.

## Files
- `Denylist.sol` — fingerprint denylist. Exact, signature, and prompt matches are hard blocks (`ExactBlock`, `SignatureBlock`, `PromptBlock`). The owner can clear an active row; `timesListed` / `everListed` and the `Listed` / `Unlisted` events stay.
- `Vault.sol` — trusted-bot registry with capability tiers and irreversible burn. Constructor: `Vault(denylist)`.
- `InsuranceFund.sol` — fee-funded backstop. Constructor: `InsuranceFund(liability)` (immutable `onlyLiability` on `payout`).
- `Liability.sol` — owner → auditor → insurance waterfall. Constructor: `Liability(insuranceFund)` or `Liability(address(0))` then `bindInsurance`.
- `DisputePanel.sol` — 3-arbitrator **allowlist**. Only `setArbitrator` appointees may vote. `openDispute` reverts until three arbitrators are seated.
- `BotAttestationEscrow.sol` — bot-to-bot escrow. Release after mutual attestation; an upheld dispute stays releasable after expiry. Panel unwind or an unresolved expiry refunds the payer.

## Deploy order (dependency-correct)

Three scripts, in this order. Agents simulate only. Spencer broadcasts. Record each address in [`deployments/base-sepolia.json`](../deployments/base-sepolia.json). Core addresses are already filled. Escrow and BVT stay null until those deploys.

### (1) Core — `script/Deploy.s.sol`

Env: `PRIVATE_KEY`, `CORE_TIMELOCK` (required, non-zero, **≠ deployer**).

Liability is created first (with `address(0)` insurance) so `InsuranceFund` can freeze the Liability address as an immutable `onlyLiability` caller, then `bindInsurance` sets the reverse pointer:

1. `Denylist`
2. `Vault(denylist)`
3. `Liability(address(0))`
4. `InsuranceFund(liability)`
5. `liability.bindInsurance(insurance)`
6. `DisputePanel`
7. `transferOwnership(CORE_TIMELOCK)` on Denylist and Vault (OZ **Ownable2Step** — deployer stays owner until the timelock calls `acceptOwnership`)
8. `setOwner(CORE_TIMELOCK)` on InsuranceFund, Liability, DisputePanel (immediate; not two-step)

**Post-step (panel seat).** `DisputePanel.openDispute` reverts `panel not seated` until `arbitratorCount >= 3`. After `setOwner`, only `CORE_TIMELOCK` can call `setArbitrator` — appoint three distinct arbitrators before any dispute is opened. The deploy script does not appoint them.

### (2) Escrow — `script/DeployBotAttestationEscrow.s.sol`

Run only after (1), using the deployed addresses. Env (all required, non-zero):

- `PRIVATE_KEY`
- `DENYLIST`
- `VAULT`
- `DISPUTE_PANEL`
- `CORE_TIMELOCK` (≠ deployer)

The script deploys `BotAttestationEscrow(denylist, vault, panel, CORE_TIMELOCK)` and `transferOwnership(CORE_TIMELOCK)`. **Ownable2Step:** the timelock must `acceptOwnership` or the deployer remains owner. `governance` is that timelock. `createEscrow` reverts until the timelock has accepted. `setDenylist`, `setVault`, and `setDisputePanel` revert unless `owner() == governance`, and they also revert while `lockedValue != 0`. A denylist swap emits `DenylistUpdated` (previous, new, caller, timestamp). That is a governance event. Production has no hot EOA admin for it. Do not fund before `acceptOwnership`. The script does not redeploy Denylist, Vault, or DisputePanel.

### (3) Optional BVT — `script/DeployBVT.s.sol`

Env: `PRIVATE_KEY`, `BVT_GUARDIAN` (required, non-zero, ≠ deployer). Optional: `BVT_INSURANCE_SINK`, `BVT_TREASURY` (default to the BVT timelock). Does not touch the core or escrow contracts. See the BVT section below.

## Chainid guard

`script/Deploy.s.sol` enforces:

| Chain | ID | Allowed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base Sepolia | **84532** | yes (default) |
| Ethereum Sepolia | 11155111 | no, unless you change `ALLOWED_CHAIN_ID` |
| Ethereum mainnet | 1 | **always revert** (`Deploy: mainnet forbidden`) |
| anything else | — | revert |

To switch the script to Ethereum Sepolia, change `ALLOWED_CHAIN_ID` to `ETH_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID` (11155111). Do not remove the mainnet check.

## Spencer deploy (you broadcast; agents do not)

Keys and RPC come from the environment only. Never commit `PRIVATE_KEY`, paste it into a PR, or pass it on a recorded command line if you can avoid it.

```bash
# one-time
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std

export BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="${BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL:-https://sepolia.base.org}"
# PRIVATE_KEY is a Base Sepolia funded key — export it in your shell, do not commit it
# CORE_TIMELOCK is a timelock or multisig (must not be the deployer) that receives ownership

# compile + local tests (no RPC, no key)
forge build
forge test

# simulate against Base Sepolia (no broadcast). CORE_TIMELOCK required (≠ deployer).
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"

# YOU run this. Agents must not --broadcast.
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" \
  --broadcast

# After the create tx: CORE_TIMELOCK acceptOwnership() on Denylist and Vault.
# Then CORE_TIMELOCK setArbitrator three times so DisputePanel.openDispute can succeed.
```

Optional verify (needs a Basescan key in the environment, not the repo):

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key "$BASESCAN_API_KEY"
```

After a successful broadcast, paste addresses below and in [`deployments/base-sepolia.json`](../deployments/base-sepolia.json). Do not commit `.env`.

### Escrow deploy (after core addresses exist)

```bash
export DENYLIST=0x...          # from the core broadcast
export VAULT=0x...
export DISPUTE_PANEL=0x...
export CORE_TIMELOCK=0x...     # same timelock; must not be the deployer

# simulate (no broadcast)
forge script script/DeployBotAttestationEscrow.s.sol:DeployBotAttestationEscrow \
  --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"

# YOU run this. Agents must not --broadcast.
forge script script/DeployBotAttestationEscrow.s.sol:DeployBotAttestationEscrow \
  --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" \
  --broadcast
```

Then `CORE_TIMELOCK` calls `acceptOwnership()` on `BotAttestationEscrow`. Do not call `createEscrow` before that accept. After accept, denylist changes go through timelock-owned `setDenylist` and revert while `lockedValue != 0`.

## Base Sepolia addresses (84532)

Core stack is live. Canonical copy: [`deployments/base-sepolia.json`](../deployments/base-sepolia.json).

PR #11 `DeployDenylist` redeployed **Denylist and Vault only**. Liability, InsuranceFund, and DisputePanel are unchanged. Escrow and BVT are not deployed. The new Vault `denylist()` is the new Denylist.

**Gate A is done on the new pair.** `acceptOwnership` is complete on both the new Denylist and the new Vault. On both, `owner` is `CORE_TIMELOCK` (`0x10CC9474b45625ADfd05C209f2518023484878D9`) and `pendingOwner` is the zero address.

`acceptOwnership` txs (status success): Denylist `0xc8ad34d956d802b3d0d8d032178c9b6786ead6afec1bd502158f1f603b3e3949` (block 47294619), Vault `0xb2aa7515c4c9bac0bbe3403bbd0bb6b8afa72452a4d4ed9ad626fc26944df9b0` (block 47294624). The earlier `transferOwnership(CORE_TIMELOCK)` txs were Denylist `0xb9767bc6c2b54ff4ae805c09b401c0c5ffb0079be0a54b7925eb9dd41758443c` (block 47294165) and Vault `0xd2b0aef1af321729e7361305a591ed7d8aacb2d84724968f979598e8be2d4076` (block 47294166).

Listing migration replay of `Listed` / `Unlisted` from the previous Denylist was empty: **0 Exact / 0 Signature / 0 Prompt**.

| Contract | Address | Tx |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Denylist | `0xeE76876bECcFc1B58fC06fF4E654a517d784B224` | `0xc4f2bf7ac1b256f79aaa566db6c88973761b41ae0e510d16e49cc2c7897c0c32` |
| Vault | `0x1463D664fA467FBCDA4B05443434494f05e565bc` | `0xeb0b97ac3c7abd49ffd99baef18703cb44563ff906e664d494325174ef6a8171` |
| InsuranceFund | `0x19fc26B36Cb2031062eD90C19db64b3b09753ab8` | `0xa71db2c304d8e80e4043e4d093a0c102ec619624ab0500d0bc7246dc27d3edd7` |
| Liability | `0x554Caf5a214B8d70D675C09186C5EAE24FEB7307` | `0x99865db9b9f4a6807b085cec8c50d22160025c4df09afc609fb52b9758fe6261` |
| DisputePanel | `0x31a92f9A25396968E14d2b55B6B0BB1482ECf1Bb` | `0x9ecd10d67054fbf9e63ad25dd1520ed809fbf94c4ab1f19ad84e81899562b77f` |
| BotAttestationEscrow | _pending Spencer deploy_ | |

Create txs: Denylist block 47294163, Vault block 47294164. The Tx column is the create transaction.

### Superseded (deprecated, left on chain)

The previous pair still has code. This redeploy did not delete it. The old Vault `denylist()` is still the old Denylist.

| Contract | Address | Tx | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Denylist | `0xF0f260967D377E07Bdd7840862508ddB23C012b8` | `0x739331697a228684f18a69c54d312baa7557dfcb92c7875c48fa7b2e4c84a429` | Deprecated. Superseded by `0xeE76876bECcFc1B58fC06fF4E654a517d784B224`. Owner remains `CORE_TIMELOCK`; `pendingOwner` is zero. Untouched by the redeploy. |
| Vault | `0xa1a067D2F58Ae54d4bb5Ec06d893B29E23A45CB7` | `0xe2524dd91b6485f1e484409610659cf3c3819ee7c0e7b5044cda5651f26a447b` | Deprecated. Superseded by `0x1463D664fA467FBCDA4B05443434494f05e565bc`. Still points at the old Denylist. |

## BVT stack (additive)

Bot Verifier Token lives under `contracts/bvt/`. It does **not** change Denylist / Vault / Liability / InsuranceFund / DisputePanel. Those contracts can later call `IBVTFeeGate` / `IAuditorStakeView` (see `contracts/bvt/IBVTHooks.sol`). Core deploy already starts Ownable2Step handoff of Denylist / Vault to `CORE_TIMELOCK`.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `bvt/BVT.sol` | ERC-20. Name **Bot Verifier Token**, symbol **BVT**. No constructor mint. |
| `bvt/BVTStaking.sol` | Auditor lock, operator bootstrap, slash. |
| `bvt/BVTFeeRouter.sol` | Registration / audit / vault fees + usage earn mint. |
| `bvt/BVTGovernor.sol` + `bvt/BVTTimelock.sol` | Stake-weighted votes; **48h** timelock. |
| `bvt/IBVTHooks.sol` | Interfaces for a later Vault/Denylist wire-up. |

Tokenomics (who mints, slash roles, fee sinks, delays): [`docs/BVT_TOKENOMICS.md`](../docs/BVT_TOKENOMICS.md).

### BVT deploy (you broadcast; agents do not)

Same chainid rules as the core script: Base Sepolia **84532** only; **mainnet always reverts**. Supply after deploy is **0**.

**Roles:** `DeployBVT.run` calls **`wireAndHarden`** (single path): timelock holds `EARNER` / `BOOTSTRAP` / `SLASHER` / `DEFAULT_ADMIN`; deployer **renounces** those plus governance/admin. Harden **reverts** if the deployer still holds any hot role. Sinks default to the **timelock**. **`BVT_GUARDIAN` is required** (non-zero, ≠ deployer — typically a multisig) and may cancel during the delay. Long-lived/valued deploys: timelock + multisig only — see SECURITY in [`docs/BVT_TOKENOMICS.md`](../docs/BVT_TOKENOMICS.md#security).

```bash
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
forge build && forge test

export BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="${BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL:-https://sepolia.base.org}"
# PRIVATE_KEY from env only — never commit
# required: BVT_GUARDIAN = non-deployer multisig (must not equal PRIVATE_KEY address)
# optional: BVT_INSURANCE_SINK, BVT_TREASURY (default = timelock)

# simulate
forge script script/DeployBVT.s.sol:DeployBVT --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"

# YOU run this. Agents must not --broadcast.
forge script script/DeployBVT.s.sol:DeployBVT --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" --broadcast
```

To switch the BVT script to Ethereum Sepolia, change `ALLOWED_CHAIN_ID` to `ETH_SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID` (11155111). Do not remove the mainnet check.

### Base Sepolia BVT addresses (84532)

Fill in after Spencer broadcasts `script/DeployBVT.s.sol`.

| Contract | Address | Tx |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BVT | _pending Spencer deploy_ | |
| BVTStaking | _pending_ | |
| BVTFeeRouter | _pending_ | |
| BVTTimelock | _pending_ | |
| BVTGovernor | _pending_ | |

## Notes
- Denylist `remove(id, bucket)` clears active membership only. History stays (`everListed`, `timesListed`, `Listed` / `Unlisted`). `bytes32(0)` is rejected. `check` stays a view and does not emit; reads are not the audit trail.
- `PromptBlock` is a hard block. Vault `register` and escrow `_verifyBot` fail closed on every `MatchLevel` other than `None`.
- Escrow `setDenylist` is callable only by immutable `governance` while that address is owner, and only when no ETH is locked. See the escrow section above.
- These are unaudited. Get a real audit before any mainnet discussion.
- Pair with `blockchain_bot/example_policy.sol` for the action leash.
- BVT is not a sale token. Mint only via earn (`BVTFeeRouter`) or operator bootstrap (`BVTStaking.bootstrapOperator`).
